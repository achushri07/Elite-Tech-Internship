# 🏏 Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

This project is part of the Elite Tech Intern **Data Analytics Internship**. The goal was to build a Machine Learning model to predict outcomes based on the dataset.
This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the number of runs a cricketer might score based on various match conditions like venue, opponent, pitch type, toss decision, and more. The prediction is powered by a trained **Random Forest Regressor** model.

## 📋 Dashboard Insights

The dashboard includes:
- **Age filter** and **Gender slicer** for user-driven interactivity
- KPIs showing:
  - Average attendance %
  - Most frequent diet quality
  - Average sleep hours
  - Maximum marks scored

### 📊 Visuals Displayed
- **Parental Education Count** – Horizontal bar chart
- **Exercise vs Sleep** – Line graph
- **Attendance Distribution** – Donut chart by attendance category
- **Gender Ratio** – Pie chart
- **Time Spent by Gender** – Bar graph comparing study and social media time

## 💡 Key Findings

- Students whose parents had **high school or bachelor’s education** were the majority.
- Most students had **poor diet quality** and **average sleep below 7 hours**.
- Only a small portion achieved **more than 90% attendance**.
- There was a near-balanced **gender ratio** in the dataset.
- **Males spent slightly more time on social media** than females on average.
