# 🏏 Task 2 – Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

This project is part of the Elite Tech Intern **Data Analytics Internship**. The goal was to build a Machine Learning model to predict outcomes based on the dataset.
This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the number of runs a cricketer might score based on various match conditions like venue, opponent, pitch type, toss decision, and more. The prediction is powered by a trained **Random Forest Regressor** model.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user selects match inputs via a form (format, pitch, opponent, etc.).
2. The data is processed and passed to a trained Random Forest model.
3. The model returns a predicted number of runs.
4. The prediction is displayed on the same page in real time.

## 📊 Model Training (Summary)

- Dataset: 300 synthetic yet realistic player records
- Features used:
  - Match Format, Venue, Opposition, Pitch Type, Toss Decision, Innings, Match Time
- Target: Runs scored
- Model: `RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)`
- Evaluation: Trained for variability (low runs on green pitches, high on flat pitches, etc.)
